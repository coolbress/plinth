# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues, specs and tickets for plinth live in GitHub Issues on
`coolbress/plinth`. Read and write them with the `gh` CLI. (This file is what
`setup-matt-pocock-skills` would create; it is pre-filled, so do not run that
skill unless you change trackers. Original: mattpocock/skills, MIT.)

## Before you write anything

Read the repository you are writing into: its `AGENTS.md`, its `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
and the issue and pull-request templates that actually apply to it. "Actually
apply" includes the owner's `owner/.github` defaults, which GitHub uses when the
repository has none of its own — a local `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` holding any
template or a `config.yml` replaces the shared set entirely, per folder, never
per file.

Writing through `gh` or the API does not exempt you from the template. It only
means nothing renders it for you, so you read it and follow it yourself.

**In a consumer repository, its conventions win.** Everything below is what
*this* repository does and what plinth offers where a repository has nothing.
Use their forms, their fields, their labels. Never rewrite an existing
repository's templates into plinth's shape.

## Three kinds of issue (this repository's default)

Forms are inherited from `coolbress/.github` (this repository has no local
`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, so all of them apply). The CLI does not render a form, so
from `gh` write the body under the form's field labels as headings and add the
form's label yourself.

| Kind | Form and label | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A request from anyone | Bug (`bug`), Feature request (`enhancement`) | The form's fields: what happened, steps, expected, environment, logs; or what you are blocked on, how you would like it, what you tried |
| A task, one thing to build | Task (`task`) | `## Parent`, `## What to build`, `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Not building`, `## Blocked by`; while open, decisions go under `## Decisions` (dated) and the result under `## Outcome` |
| A record: research, a decision, a map, a spec | blank issue; the kind is a label: `wayfinder:map`, `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:grilling`, or `spec` (the door creates them), plus the triage label while open | `## Question`, `## Findings`, `## Decision`, `## Used by` for research; the map and the spec keep their own shape |

The body is the record and stays canonical; comments are conversation, and
a decision made in a comment is moved into the body. Add one triage label
from [triage-labels.md](triage-labels.md): `needs-triage` by default,
`ready-for-agent` when the issue is fully specified.

## What a record has to carry

Whatever the format, these survive:

- **An issue**: the problem, why it is worth solving, what done looks like,
  the decisions taken and their reasons, and the outcome on closing.
- **A pull request**: the final change, why this approach, the evidence and its
  limits, and the related issue.

When a discussion or a review changes the conclusion, update the body. Keep the
earlier reasoning and the reason it was corrected; a record that shows only the
final answer cannot be argued with.

Distinguish **completed** from **cancelled**, **superseded**, and **moved to a
follow-up** — closing is not one state. Distinguish an automated check from an
agent review from a person's own use of the thing from something not run at all.

A filled-in section is not value and an edited file is not completion. Judge by
what the record says happened, not by whether the headings are all present.

Fields, labels and syntax that automation depends on are followed exactly:
`Closes` auto-closes, a label drives triage queries, and a form's field id is
read by tooling. Precision there is not style.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Multi-line bodies via heredoc.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` (filter with `--label`, `--state`)
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

`gh` reads the repository from `git remote -v`, so run it inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** *(Change to `yes` to treat external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this line.))*

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue. Acceptance criteria map to checks (see `AGENTS.md`).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

`gh issue view <number> --comments`

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. A **map** is one issue; tickets are its **child** issues.

- **Map**: one issue labelled `wayfinder:map`. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`
- **Child ticket**: a sub-issue of the map (`gh api` sub-issues endpoint). If sub-issues are unavailable, add it to the map's task list and start the child body with `Part of #<map>`. Label: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research` / `prototype` / `grilling` / `task`). Assign yourself when you claim it.
- **Blocking**: GitHub native issue dependencies. `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`), not `#number` or `node_id`. Fallback: start the child body with `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>`. Unblocked once every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: open children of the map with no open blocker and no assignee, first in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: put the answer in the body (`## Findings`, `## Decision`, `## Outcome`; the body is the record, a comment is not), then `gh issue close <n>`, then one line (gist + link) under the map's Decisions-so-far.
